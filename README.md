# Docker Redsocks Proxy

With this container, you can redirect all TCP traffic through a SOCKS5 proxy, with optional DNSCrypt integration for secure DNS resolution.

## Features:

- Route all TCP traffic or just specific ports through the proxy
- DNSCrypt for DoH (DNS over HTTPS) name resolution through the proxy (can be disabled)
- Easy configuration via environment variables

## Example Usage

In this example, the HTTP and HTTPS traffic of the `debian` container will always be redirected through the configured proxy. This requires that your Docker host is already connected to the VPN network (in this case, Mullvad VPN).

### Published Ports

If your container behind `redsocks` exposes a port, that port is mirrored to the `redsocks` container. You can access it by opening the port on the `redsocks` container:

```yaml
services:
  redsocks:
    image: mietzen/redsocks-proxy:stable
    hostname: redsocks
    ports:
      - "8080:2001" # Port exposure on redsocks
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - NET_RAW
    environment:
      - PROXY_SERVER=de-ber-wg-socks5-005.relays.mullvad.net
      - PROXY_PORT=1080
    dns: 9.9.9.9
    restart: unless-stopped
  whoami:
    image: traefik/whoami
    depends_on:
      redsocks:
        condition: service_healthy
    command:
       - --port=2001
    network_mode: service:redsocks
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:8080/
Hostname: redsocks
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: ::1
IP: 172.20.0.2
IP: fe80::42:acff:fe14:2
RemoteAddr: 172.16.0.1:59666
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: curl/8.9.1
Accept: */*
```
